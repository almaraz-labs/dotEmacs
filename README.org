* Introduction

My personal Emacs Configuration.

I was recently inspired by [[https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch][emacs-from-scratch]] to try out a org babel literal configuration, this is my rendition. I personally like the concept of a modularized configuration code base, both in Org format and it's tangled Emacs Lisp format. I believe that the init.el file should include a minimal set of logic, but rather mainly serves to loaded in needed logic and library packages.

For more information on my configuration see [[https://github.com/skribest/dotEmacs/blob/main/Emacs.org][Emacs.org]].
