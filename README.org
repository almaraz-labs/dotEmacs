* Introduction
My personal Emacs Configuration.

I was recently inspired by [[https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch][emacs-from-scratch]] to try out a org babel Literal configuration, which infact I did, however, I didn't want to do away completely with my first emacs configuration inspired by [[https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/my-dot-emacs-file][steve yegge]], so the resulting configuration is a combination of both. Overall, I find this setup to be better for my workflow. I am still planning on utilizing the power of Babel and literate programming for other projects of mine...
